Yes, the output log you shared looks correct and indicates that the training process is progressing as expected. Here's a breakdown of the key points from the log:

Filtering Dataset:

The dataset is filtered to 2000 samples as shown by the line Filtered dataset length: 2000.
Training Progress:

The training is being performed in K-Fold cross-validation (5 folds) with each epoch consisting of multiple iterations.
The validation loss is reported for each fold at the end of each epoch.
Validation Loss Improvement:

The validation loss is consistently decreasing, which is a good sign that the model is learning and improving.
Each time the validation loss improves, it is indicated and the model is saved, e.g., Validation loss decreased (inf --> 5.486603). Saving model ....
GPU Utilization:

GPU utilization is printed at the end of each epoch, e.g., Allocated: 2.7 GB Reserved: 8.0 GB.
Early Stopping:

Early stopping counters and messages are printed if the validation loss does not improve, but in this case, it appears the loss is consistently improving, so early stopping has not been triggered.
Overall, the output indicates that the training is running smoothly, the model is improving, and checkpoints are being saved as expected. If you have any specific concerns or need further details, please let me know!
